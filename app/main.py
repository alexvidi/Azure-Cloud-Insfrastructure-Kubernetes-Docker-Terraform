"""
Simple FastAPI application that exposes three endpoints:

- GET /health   -> Basic health check for Kubernetes and monitoring.
- GET /quote    -> Returns a synthetic market quote for a supported symbol.
- GET /metrics  -> Exposes Prometheus metrics for scraping.

This file focuses only on the HTTP API layer.
The business logic is intentionally lightweight and honest: the API returns
synthetic quotes for a small symbol catalog so the repository can focus on
cloud delivery and runtime operations rather than fake machine learning.
